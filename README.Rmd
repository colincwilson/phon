[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)


The goal of `phon` is to make available the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary 
([**cmudict**](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict)) in an R friendly 
format, and to collect some tools which use the pronunciation information.

The CMU Pronouncing Dictionary includes pronunciations for 130,000 words. By matching
the phonemes between words, `phon` provides

* `phonemes('threw')` - Returns the phonemes for the pronunciation of "threw".
* `homophones('steak')` - Returns words which are homophones of "steak".
* `rhymes('carry')` - Returns words which rhyme with "carry".
* `sounds_like('statistics')` - Returns words with a similar sound to
  "statistics" by limiting the mismatches in phonemes the other word can have.
* `contains_phonemes(c('TH', 'R', 'UW'))` Returns words which contain the given phoneme sequence.
* `syllables("useless")` Returns the count of syllables in "useless".


This is a companion package to the [syn](http://syn.njtierney.com/) package. 
`syn` finds related words based upon meanings, while `phon` finds related words based upon
pronunciation.

## Installation

You can install `phon` from github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("coolbutuseless/phon")
```


## Phonemes

Phonemes are the sounds which make up a word.

The phonetic encoding in `phon` come from the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary 
([**cmudict**](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict))
which encodes words using [ARPABET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET).


```{r}
phon::phonemes("cellar")
```


Since some words have mutliple pronunciations, the results of `phon::phonemes()`
can be a vector with more than 1 element, e.g. *carry* has two slightly different 
pronunciations.

```{r}
phon::phonemes("carry")
```

ARPABET phonetic encoding includes stress markers as suffixes to vowel phonemes. The markers are:

0. No stress
1. Primary stress
2. Secondary stress

You can ask for phonemes without the stress markers, e.g.

```{r}
phon::phonemes("fantastic")

phon::phonemes("fantastic", keep_stresses = TRUE)
```



## Syllables

The number of syllables in a word is obtained by counting of the number of phonemes with 
stress markers. 

```{r}
phon::syllables("average")

phon::syllables("antidisestablishmentarianism")
```




## Matching Phonemes within Words

`phon` allows you to search for the sound of one word within another.

In the following example, `phon::contains_phonemes()` finds all the words that
include the pronunciation of *"through"* within their pronunciation.

```{r}
through <- phon::phonemes("through")[[1]]
through
```

```{r}
phon::contains_phonemes(through)
```



Use the `keep_stresses` argument to match with/without the stresses included (default is
to ignore the stresses).



## Homophones

Homophones are words with the same pronunciation but different spelling.

```{r}
phon::homophones("steak")

phon::homophones("carry")
```



## Rhymes

To find rhymes, `phon` compares trailing phonemes. If the phonemes at the end of a
word in the dictionary match those at the end of the given word, then they rhyme.

The rhymes are returned in multiple vectors:

* Words with the most matching trailing phonemes are returned first.
* Subsequent vectors have fewer matching trailing phonemes.


```{r eval = FALSE}
phon::rhymes("drudgery")
```

    [[1]]
     [1] "challengery"  "forgery"      "gingery"      "injury"       "margery"     
     [6] "marjorie"     "marjory"      "menagerie"    "neurosurgery" "perjury"     
    [11] "surgery"     
    
    [[2]]
      [1] "acary"           "accessory"       "adoree"          "adultery"       
      [5] "advisory"        "alimentary"      "alphandery"      "ambery"         
      [9] .... (results trimmed)



In the above example:

* The phonemes for "drudgery" are "D R AH1 JH ER0 IY0"
* In the first vector, the words match the *-gery* sound, i.e the last 3 phonemes.
* In the second vector the words only match the *-ery* sound, i.e. the last 2 phonemes.





## Similar sounding words

Similar sounding words are found by comparing words with the same number
of phonemes but with a number of mismatches allowed.

```{r}
phon::sounds_like("statistics", phoneme_mismatches = 5)
```


## CMU Pronouncing Dictionary

This package relies on the great Pronouncing Dictionary by CMU.
